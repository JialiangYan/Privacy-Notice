      In a salute to naval history and video game innovation, Wargaming's World
      of Warships &mdash; a massive multiplayer online naval combat game &mdash;
      is adding the USS Wisconsin to its roster of more than 800 vessels
      starting April 17, which also marks the ship's 80th anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steeped in history, the USS Wisconsin played a pivotal role in World War
      II and beyond. From the Pacific Theater battles to its resurgence during
      Operation Desert Storm, this battleship has left an indelible mark on
      military history. Today, as part of Nauticus, a Maritime Discovery Center
      located in Norfolk, Virginia, the Wisconsin serves as a floating museum
      &mdash; a tangible link to the past &mdash; by offering visitors a glimpse
      into its illustrious legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To commemorate the USS Wisconsin anniversary and the upcoming 80th
      anniversary of D-Day, World of Warships is spreading awareness about this
      historical vessel, honoring military families, and making naval history
      accessible to video game and history enthusiasts alike through several USS
      Wisconsin-focused initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Active service members and veterans who visit the Nauticus and the USS
      Wisconsin during April will enjoy complimentary admission courtesy of
      World of Warships. For those unable to visit in person, World of Warships
      is offering a virtual alternative.

      The game makers recently conducted a livestream providing a tour of the
      USS Wisconsin, examining the ship from stem to stern and exploring the
      vessel's storied past. This stream allowed viewers to delve into the
      ship's history. It featured a special appearance by a Desert Storm veteran
      who served aboard the vessel, offering valuable insights and anecdotes.
      The 60-minute archived stream is available to view on World of Warships'{' '}
      Twitch channel.

      World of Warships has naval history coded into its DNA and remains
      steadfast in its commitment to preserving naval history. Through
      educational initiatives like the "Naval Legends" YouTube series and
      partnerships with maritime museums like Nauticus and the USS Wisconsin,
      the game fosters an appreciation for naval heritage. Because many of these
      museums are underfunded and run by volunteers, often veterans, World of
      Warships actively fundraises to restore museum ships and raise awareness
      of their vital role in preserving history for current and future
      generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      World of Warships is a free-to-play naval warfare game where players
      command historical warships from various nations in intense multiplayer
      battles. The game offers a wide range of vessels, from nimble destroyers
      to powerful battleships and aircraft carriers. With strategic gameplay,
      realistic ship mechanics and stunning visuals, World of Warships immerses
      players in epic naval combat across diverse environments.

      And now, with the addition of the Wisconsin (fondly called "Big Wisky"),
      players will have three months to build a virtual USS Wisconsin, known as
      a Tier X ship in the game, from the ground up in 30 phases and at each of
      those phases receive different rewards to ease their progress in the game,
      as well as another ship, a recreation of the USS West Virginia, a Colorado
      class battleship. Once complete, players will have the opportunity to
      captain the ship in naval battles independently and in group missions.
