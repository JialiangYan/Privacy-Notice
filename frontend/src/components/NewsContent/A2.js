      For many Gen Z-ers, scrolling on social media has become a primary source
      of entertainment and a tool for staying connected. In fact, the majority
      of Gen Z Americans report going on at least one social media platform each
      day. Reasons for turning to social media include combatting boredom (66%),
      the desire to laugh or smile (59%) or to see what&rsquo;s happening in the
      world (49%).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, often, when scrolling, the content isn&rsquo;t necessarily what
      you were looking for &mdash; or worse, it causes stress or anxiety. In
      fact, over half of Gen-Zers (53%) said they are frustrated because what
      they see on their social media feeds doesn't match what they want to see
      and just as many (54%) believe they have either "some," "little," or "no
      control at all" over the content that pops up on their feeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      This data, from a new survey by LG Electronics and conducted by Talker
      Research, found 62% of Gen Z-ers wish they could just reset their feeds
      and start all over. The survey also found 73% of respondents associate at
      least one social media platform with a negative impact on their mental
      health.

      According to social media expert and associate professor Casey Fiesler,
      Ph.D., algorithms play a significant role in the content you see, so
      understanding how they work is key to improving your feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Algorithms are recommendations that determine what you see on social
      media by predicting content you're likely to engage with based on past
      engagement," said Fiesler. "These algorithms can send you down ever more
      specific niches &mdash; for good and bad. When left unchecked, you can
      quickly go down negative rabbit holes and encounter harmful content. The
      good news? You do have some control over the input for these algorithms:
      by choosing to engage with optimistic content, you'll probably see more of
      it."

      <strong>Increasing optimistic content in your feeds</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to improve your algorithm to include more positive content is to
      avoid engaging with negative content, and making a point to engage with
      content you actually want to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help everyone have a positive experience and regain some control of
      social media feeds, LG created a global playlist called "Optimism Your
      Feed," which is designed to bring more positivity to your social media
      feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Optimism Your Feed" is part of LG's Life's Good campaign, introduced last
      year to inspire and encourage people to approach life with an optimistic
      attitude. Created in collaboration with global influencers renowned for
      their positive outlook, including Tina Choi, Victoria Browne and Josh
      Harmon, the playlist includes over 20 short-form videos full of
      motivational messages and feel-good content.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you see content on your feed that improves your mood, such as LG's
      'Optimism Your Feed' playlist, give it extra attention," said Fiesler.
      "'Like' the content and leave positive comments on your favorite posts or
      videos. Giving upbeat, optimistic posts increased engagement means you're
      more likely to see positive content like that in the future."
