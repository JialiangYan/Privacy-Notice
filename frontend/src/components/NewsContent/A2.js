      Steve Rouillard of Detroit has always been a hands-on, do-it-yourself
      person. His life as an aerospace engineer keeps him busy, while in his
      spare time, he enjoys frequent getaways to the Smoky Mountains. Two years
      ago, however, his busy routine was interrupted by a series of strokes that
      happened unexpectedly, and left his doctors puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a hot summer day, Steve was outside staining a fence when he felt
      strangely exhausted. Brushing it off as possible dehydration from the
      heat, Steve flew to Tennessee the next day, but noticed that he was still
      not feeling right. He lost his appetite, and all he wanted to do was rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctors suspected COVID-19, but tests came back with nothing out of the
      ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The following week, I woke up still not feeling right,&rdquo; Steve
      said. &ldquo;I told my wife, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take this anymore.
      Something is wrong with me,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After being re-evaluated by his doctors at home in Michigan, Steve finally
      had an answer: what he experienced was a stroke. While he was relieved to
      receive a diagnosis, his health journey didn&rsquo;t end there.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a year later, Steve was speaking with his wife when he noticed he
      couldn&rsquo;t say certain basic words. After going to the hospital, an
      MRI revealed that Steve had suffered three additional strokes. Steve is
      one of the more than 795,000 people in the United States who have a stroke
      every year.<sup>1</sup> This time, doctors suspected his strokes might be
      due to an underlying heart rhythm issue. They prescribed Steve blood
      thinners and placed a small heart monitor, the Medtronic Reveal
      LINQ&trade; insertable cardiac monitor (ICM), just underneath the skin in
      Steve&rsquo;s chest. ICMs monitor for and can detect intermittent abnormal
      heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), which can lead to stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a few months later, Steve would learn just how valuable his small
      heart monitor would be. After returning from a trip to Germany, he passed
      out while sitting on the porch. His cardiologist called, saying the heart
      monitor had detected that Steve&rsquo;s heart had stopped beating for
      eight seconds. Steve&rsquo;s doctor recommended a pacemaker immediately to
      prevent future incidents where Steve&rsquo;s heart might beat too slowly
      and cause him to pass out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve received the world&rsquo;s smallest pacemaker, the Medtronic Micra
      AV2&trade; . Unlike a traditional pacemaker, the leadless pacemaker is the
      size of a vitamin pill and is implanted inside the heart using a tiny
      catheter inserted through a vein. The minimally invasive procedure allowed
      Steve to leave the hospital the same day, with limited restrictions. While
      each patient&rsquo;s experience can vary, since Steve&rsquo;s procedure,
      he&rsquo;s regained his active life, and hasn&rsquo;t experienced any
      additional heart rhythm issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the procedure, I laid in the recovery room for a few hours
      and then within a few days went back to normal life,&rdquo; Steve added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Steve lives life to its fullest. With his Micra AV2, he is once
      again able to take on home renovations, travel for work and build
      furniture in his free time, knowing that he has a pacemaker to help keep
      his heartbeat from dropping dangerously low.
    </p>
    <p>
      This National Stroke Awareness Month, Steve is advocating for people like
      himself to take the signs of stroke seriously and get checked out by
      specialists who can help you understand the right treatment options for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I don&rsquo;t often have weak legs, speech issues or fatigue. I am
      very thankful,&rdquo; said Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      This testimonial is based on Steve&rsquo;s experience. Not all patients
      will experience similar results. Always talk to your doctor about
      diagnosis, treatment and risk information.
