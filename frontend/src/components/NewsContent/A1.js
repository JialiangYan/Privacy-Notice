      Time is money, and there&rsquo;s a premium: Americans say their time is
      worth $240 per hour, on average, according to{' '}
      <strong>new research from Empower</strong>, a financial services company.
      Based on a standard 40-hour week, that puts the perceived value at
      $499,200 per year &mdash; nearly eight times higher than the average U.S.
      salary of $59,384.<sup>1</sup> One third of people set the price at under
      $50 per hour, though 1 in 4 Millennials value their time at over $500 per
      hour &mdash; the highest of any generation (just 6% of Boomers name that
      rate).
    </p>

      Many Americans are racing against the clock when it comes to financial
      goals: half think they&rsquo;re running out of time to save for
      retirement, even though 44% say they started putting money away early
      enough. Another 43% wish they could go back in time to start saving
      sooner, and half (48%) would rather have a longer retirement period with
      less money, than retire later in life with more.

      People may be further along than they think. According to Empower Personal
      Dashboard&trade; data, the average 401(k) balance clocks in at $291,810
      and for people in their 50s approaching retirement age, the number jumps
      to $580,259<sup>2</sup> &mdash; one key measure of overall personal
      savings and investments.

        study&rsquo;s findings of how Americans value their time, two hours of
        meetings at work cost close to $500 per person; catching nightly

      <strong>Sign of the times</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Americans are having to work alongside the wider economy on their journey
      to hit their goals. Though 30% of adults are not keeping track of any
      financial &ldquo;signs of the times,&rdquo; around a quarter are keeping
      an eye on shrinkflation (24%), as product sizes get smaller for the same
      or more cost. It can be a struggle, as more than 3 in 4 Americans believe
      they&rsquo;re doing as much as they can to save money while shopping
      (76%). Some 22% of Americans are also keeping track of their ability to
      retire and when (22%), as nearly half (48%) worry about how they&rsquo;ll
      pay for expenses once they&rsquo;re no longer working.
