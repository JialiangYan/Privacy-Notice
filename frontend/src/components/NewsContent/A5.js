      Can you imagine living in a world on the brink of imminent catastrophe,
      caught between superpowers dueling over the very future of mankind?
    </p>
    <p>
      While this sounds like the plot of a science fiction story, it was reality
      for millions of people throughout the five-decades-long geopolitical
      tension between the United States and the Soviet Union known as the Cold
      War.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Christmas
      Day in 1991 but it continues to influence cultural and political discourse
      in 2024.

      The 2023 film &ldquo;Oppenheimer,&rdquo; which recently won seven Academy
      Awards, told the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the architects of
      the first atomic bomb &mdash; the precursor of the more advanced nuclear
      weapons that kept the world on edge during the Cold War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just this month, Netflix released a documentary entitled, &ldquo;Turning
      Point: The Bomb and The Cold War,&rdquo; which documents the development
      of nuclear weapons, the tensions between the United States and the Soviet
      Union, and asks viewers, considering the current war between Russia and
      Ukraine, to consider whether the Cold War ever really ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cold War&rsquo;s lasting impact simply cannot be overstated, and
      understanding the conflict is essential to making sense of the world we
      live in today.
    </p>

      Congress recently designated the National Cold War Center (NCWC), which
      will be located on the site of the former Eaker Air Force base in
      Blytheville, Arkansas, as America&rsquo;s official museum of the Cold War.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set to open in the fall of 2027, the NCWC will be the best place in the
      world to learn about the profound history and global impact of the Cold
      War through immersive experiences and tours of original U.S. Air Force
      facilities that played a key role in America&rsquo;s victory in the
      conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of the center&rsquo;s official opening, visitors can experience a
      taste of what is to come by visiting the Blytheville Air Force Base (BAFB)
      Exhibition, which tells the story of the Blytheville (later renamed Eaker)
      Air Force Base and the heroes who manned it during the Cold War. As a
      Strategic Air Command, the base housed B-52 bombers capable of launching
      with 15 minutes&rsquo; notice and armed with nuclear warheads three times
      more powerful than the bombs dropped on Nagasaki during World War II.

      Christian Ostermann, an award-winning historian of the Cold War, is the
      founding director of the Wilson Center&rsquo;s History and Public Policy
      Program and oversees the center&rsquo;s Cold War International History
      Project. Ostermann also serves as co-chair of the NCWC&rsquo;s National
      Advisory Board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ostermann has spent 25 years studying the Cold War, its historical
      significance, and how its legacy continues to shape our world today.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cold War was an epic struggle between the United States and the
      Soviet Union over power, influence and resources. It was also a struggle
      of ideas and ideologies, of how best to organize a modern society &mdash;
      our way of life,&rdquo; said Ostermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Cold War was primarily a high-stakes duel between the United
      States and the Soviet Union, the imminent threat of nuclear war and its
      unimaginable consequences impacted every corner of the globe, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Blytheville, we have this authentic site that can bring that
      history to life &mdash; what it felt like to fight, and survive, the Cold
      War,&rdquo; said Ostermann.
