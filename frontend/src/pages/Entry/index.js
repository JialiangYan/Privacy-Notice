          This study is being conducted for research at the University of
          Alberta. The purpose of it is to collect feedback on the user
          experience from app installation to usage process of our news app
          "QuickNews". To do this, you will perform a simulated app installation
          and usage task and answer some questionnaires.
        </p>
        <p>Specific study activities include:</p>
        <ul className={styles.lst}>
          <li>using your iPhone to visit our website</li>
          <li>simulate to install our app</li>
          <li>simulate to use our app</li>
          <li>answering questionnaires about your experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must meet the following criteria to participate in this study:
        </p>
        <ul className={styles.lst}>
          <li>be an adult</li>
          <li>be an iPhone user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your participation should take around 25 minutes. The data collected
          from this study will be used in articles for publication in journals
          and conference proceedings. Any write-ups of the data will not include
          information that can be linked directly to you.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.title2}>Benefits</div>
        <p>
          Other than the receipt of a small honorarium, you will not directly
          benefit from your participation. Information gathered in this research
          will help us improve existing smartphone user experience and develop
          new interaction design that could benefit users.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.title2}>Risk</div>
        <p>
          While it is always possible that someone can figure out who
          participated in a study, we will remove all identifying information
          from your data before analyzing it in order to make it harder for
          people to tell who has participated.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no other foreseeable risks. If at any time, we become aware
          of additional risks, we will postpone the study and notify you
          immediately so that these risks can be minimized before we continue
          with research activities. If it is necessary, we will stop the study
          altogether.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.title2}>Remuneration/Compensation</div>
        <p>
          To thank you for your time, we will be pleased to make a summary of
          the results available to you once they have been compiled. This
          summary will outline the research and discuss our findings and
          recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>You are also eligible to receive $8 after completing the study.</p>
        <div className={styles.title2}>Confidentiality & Anonymity</div>
        <p>
          No one will be identified in this study and identifying personal
          information will be removed. Reports and publications detailing the
          results of this research will describe aggregate data. Where quotes
          are included, we will take care to select quotes that will not
          identify the speaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data and documents will be securely kept for a period of at least
          5 years after we have finished our research activities. Data may be
          kept for even longer. If we decide not to keep it after 5 years, it
          will be destroyed.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.title2}>
          Voluntary Participation & Freedom to Withdraw
        </div>
        <p>
          You get to choose whether you want to complete study activities. It is
          okay if you donâ€™t want us to use your data. We can always exclude your
          data while analyzing that of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may withdraw at any time. To withdraw, exit our study website and
          we will destroy any of the data that we have collected from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not participate in this study or choose to withdraw from
          this study, the data that was collected during your participation will
          be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that you cannot have your data removed if you have already
          completed this study.
